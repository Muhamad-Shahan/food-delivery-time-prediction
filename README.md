Predicting food delivery times using Machine Learning and Python

Predicting delivery times accurately remains a pivotal challenge for food delivery giants like Zomato and Swiggy. In my recent project, I tackled this challenge by leveraging Machine Learning techniques to enhance delivery time estimations.

**Project Focus:**
The cornerstone of our approach was calculating the distance between the order pickup and delivery points. By analyzing historical data on delivery times for similar distances, we developed a robust predictive model using Python.

**Key Methodologies:**
1. **Data Collection:** Curated a comprehensive dataset detailing past delivery times and corresponding distances.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracted pertinent features such as traffic conditions, time of day, and delivery partner performance.
3. **Model Development:** Implemented advanced regression models to train and validate our predictive algorithms.
4. **Real-world Application:** Deployed the model to generate real-time delivery time predictions, ensuring operational efficiency.

**Project Impact:**
This initiative not only honed my skills in Machine Learning for logistics but also underscored its critical role in optimizing service delivery and customer satisfaction. By accurately forecasting delivery times, we aimed to elevate the user experience and streamline operations.
